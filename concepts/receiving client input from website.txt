To build a website that allows users to send text messages, and to store and analyze these messages, you need to
implement several components and techniques. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:

1. Frontend (Client-Side)
The frontend will provide a user interface for users to input and send their messages. This can be 
implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

2. Backend (Server-Side)
The backend wil handle incoming requests from the frontend and store the messages in a database. This can be implemented using a web framework
like Flask (Python) or Express (Node.js).

3. Database
A database is essential for storing and retrieving messages. SQLAlchemy is used with SQLite. You can
choose other databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB depending on your needs.

4. API Endpoint
A digital location where an API receives requests about a specific resource on its server. In APIs, an endpoint
is typically a uniform resource locator (URL) that provides the location of a resource on the server.

5. Deployment
To deploy your application, you can use platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean. Ensure your database is properly configured
and accessible by your application

Summary
By following these steps, you can create a modular and scalable web application where users can send text messages.
The frontend captures user input and sends it to the backend via an API (Bridge between front-end and back-end). The backend processes the input, 
stores it in a database, and can later retrieve and analyze the messages as needed.

Additional Enhancements
- User Authentication: Implement user authentication to track messages by user
- Message Analysis: Add functionality to analyze stored messages, such as keyword extraction or sentiment analysis.
- Real-time Updates: Use WebSockets for real-time message updates if necessary.
- Security: Ensure data validation and sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS attacks

By building and integrating these components, you will have a robust system for receiving, storing, and analyzing user messages.
